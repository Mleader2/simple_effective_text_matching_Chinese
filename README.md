## Simple and Effective Text Matching

RE2 is a fast and strong neural architecture for general purpose text matching applications. 
In a text matching task, a model takes two text sequences as input and predicts their relationship.
This method aims to explore what is sufficient for strong performance in these tasks. 
It simplifies or omits many slow components which are previously considered as core building blocks in text matching.
It achieves its performance by a simple idea, which is keeping three key features directly available for inter-sequence alignment and fusion: 
previous aligned features (**R**esidual vectors), original point-wise features (**E**mbedding vectors), and contextual features (**E**ncoder output).

RE2 achieves performance on par with the state of the art on four benchmark datasets: SNLI, SciTail, Quora and WikiQA,
across tasks of natural language inference, paraphrase identification and answer selection 
with no or few task-specific adaptations. It has at least 6 times faster inference speed compared with similarly performed models.

The following table lists major experiment results. 
The paper reports the average and standard deviation of 10 runs and the results can be easily reproduced. 
Inference time (in seconds) is measured by processing a batch of 8 pairs of length 20 on Intel i7 CPUs.
The computation time of POS features used by CSRAN and DIIN is not included.

## Setup

- install python >= 3.6 and pip
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- install Tensorflow 1.4 or above (the wheel file for Tensorflow 1.4 gpu version under python 3.6 can be found 
[here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.4.1-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl))
- Download [GloVe word vectors](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (glove.840B.300d) to `resources/`

Data used in the paper are prepared as follows:

### SNLI

- Download and unzip [SNLI](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0r82spk628ksz70/SNLI.zip?dl=0) 
(pre-processed by [Tay et al.](https://github.com/vanzytay/EMNLP2018_NLI)) to `data/orig`. 
- Unzip all zip files in the "data/orig/SNLI" folder. (`cd data/orig/SNLI && gunzip *.gz`)
- `cd data && python prepare_snli.py` 

### SciTail

- Download and unzip [SciTail](http://data.allenai.org.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/SciTailV1.1.zip) 
dataset to `data/orig`.
- `cd data && python prepare_scitail.py`

### Quora

- Download and unzip [Quora](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0PlTAo--BnaQWlsZl9FZ3l1c28/view?usp=sharing)
dataset (pre-processed by [Wang et al.](https://github.com/zhiguowang/BiMPM)) to `data/orig`.
- `cd data && python prepare_quora.py`

### WikiQA

- Download and unzip [WikiQA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52419)
to `data/orig`.
- `cd data && python prepare_wikiqa.py`
- Download and unzip [evaluation scripts](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/mengqiu/data/qg-emnlp07-data.tgz). 
Use the `make -B` command to compile the source files in `qg-emnlp07-data/eval/trec_eval-8.0`.
Move the binary file "trec_eval" to `resources/`.

## Usage

To train a new text matching model, run the following command: 

```bash
python train.py $config_file.json5
```

Example configuration files are provided in `configs/`:

- `configs/main.json5`: replicate the main experiment result in the paper.
- `configs/robustness.json5`: robustness checks
- `configs/ablation.json5`: ablation study

The instructions to write your own configuration files:

```json5
[
    {
        name: 'exp1', // name of your experiment, can be the same across different data
        __parents__: [
            'default', // always put the default on top
            'data/quora', // data specific configurations in `configs/data`
            // 'debug', // use "debug" to quick debug your code  
        ],
        __repeat__: 5,  // how may repetitions you want
        blocks: 3, // other configurations for this experiment 
    },
    // multiple configurations are executed sequentially
    {
        name: 'exp2', // results under the same name will be overwritten
        __parents__: [
            'default', 
            'data/quora',
        ],
        __repeat__: 5,  
        blocks: 4, 
    }
]
```

To check the configurations only, use

```bash
python train.py $config_file.json5 --dry
```
